Reading Group @ DFKI-MOM
========================
Reading group about Machine Learning topics at DFKI

Guidelines:
-----------
+ You don't need faculty.
+ Be fearless. Ask dumb questions.
+ Choose your own papers to present.
+ It is better to show a paper PDF up on a projector than cancel a meeting. 
+ After a major conference, have all of the people who attended the conference present their "top K paper." 
+ Meetings on Raskin, Tuesdays@11:00

Participants:
-------------
+ FR: Federico Raue
+ SP: Sebastian Palacio
+ TK: Tushar Karayil
+ PB: Philipp Blandfort
+ VC: Victor Campos
